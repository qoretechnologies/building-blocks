    ## Summary


    Building block that throws an `FSM-BREAK` exception to provide a `break`
    action when executing an FSM.


    There is no configuration


    **NOTE**:  This building block's functionality has been superceded by an API
    (request - response) data provider; it's recommended to use the `util/break`
    API data provider in the `qorus-api` factory instead
