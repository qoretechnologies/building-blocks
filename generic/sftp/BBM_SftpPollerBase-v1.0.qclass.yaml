    ## Summary


    Generic building block class for polling for files from an SFTP server.


    This class is meant to be used as a base class for interfaces (normally a
    job or a service) that provide SFTP polling as an event connector.


    If config item `sftp-polling-file-connection` is set, then files are
    streamed efficiently to the given local file system location and not stored
    in memory.  If this config item is not set, then all files are transferred
    and stored in main memory, which can cause problems with very large files.


    If uploads to the SFTP server are not atomic, the `sftp-polling-minage`
    config item can be used to ensure that files are only polled after they have
    been present on the FTP server for a defined period of time, which should be
    greater than the maximum time required to transfer the largest files.


    Note that this class can be used in either a job or a service to provide
    regular polling for files from an SFTP server.  Use in a job is encouraged,
    as the job schedule is easily controlled by operational users and is the
    pollijng schedule, additionally the results of each polling operation are
    exposed in the UI and in the API as job results, making it easier to monitor
    the SFTP polling status.


    ## Connectors


    ### Input/Output Connector `pollForFiles`


    Used to poll for files once and return file data as output for all files
    polled.  Input data is ignored.


    ### Input/Output Connector `start`


    This connector can be used in a service to poll in a service's `start()`
    method in a background thread.  In order to use this class's `sftpFileEvent`
    connector, this connector must be used as the service's `start()` method.


    Input data is ignored and passed through to the output data.


    ### Input/Output Connector `stop`


    This connector can be used in a service to stop polling in a service's
    `stop()` method.   In order to use this class's `sftpFileEvent` connector,
    this connector must be used as the service's `stop()` method.


    Input data is ignored and passed through to the output data.


    ### Event Connector `sftpFileEvent`


    This event connector can be used in a service to process file events once
    they have been polled and fully transferred to the server.  In order to use
    this connector, the `start` and `stop` connectors must be used in a
    service's `start()` and `stop()` methods to start and stop the polling
    thread, respectively.
