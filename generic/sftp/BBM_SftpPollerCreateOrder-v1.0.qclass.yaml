    ## Summary


    Building block class for polling for files from an SFTP server and creating
    a workflow order from files polled.


    The local context data for the internal workflow order creation call is the
    file event data as described by data type
    `qoretechnologies/building-blocks/sftp/event`; therefore this information
    can be used when creating the order; for example
    `create-workflow-staticdata` = `$local:*` would set the initial static order
    data to the file event hash.


    Duplicates can be detected from order keys, i.e. if one of the following
    config items is used:

    - `create-workflow-specific-unique-key`

    - `create-workflow-unique-key`

    - `create-workflow-global-unique-key`


    In this case this object also contains configuration that allows for an
    alternative "duplicate-file-handling" workflow order to be created.  See
    config items in the **SFTP Polling Workflow Creation Duplicate File
    Handling** group for more information.
