    ## Summary


    Binds a subworkflow in a subworkflow step.


    This building block uses the input data for binding; for a building block
    that binds based on configuration, see `BBM_BindSubworkflowStatic`


    This building block is useful only in limited use cases;
    `BBM_BindSubworkflowStatic` can do everything this building block can do and
    more; it's recommended to use `BBM_BindSubworkflowStatic` instead.


    **NOTE**:  This building block's functionality has been superceded by an API
    (request - response) data provider; it's recommended to use the
    `util/workflow/bind-subworkflow` API data provider in the `qorus-api`
    factory instead


    ## Connectors


    ### Input/Output Connector `bindSubworkflow`


    Binds the subworkflow based on the input data; configuration is only used to
    identify the workflow and to specify output data handling.
