    ## Summary


    Building block that throws an `FSM-CONTINUE` exception to provide a
    `continue` action when executing an FSM.


    There is no configuration


    **NOTE**:  This building block's functionality has been superceded by an API
    (request - response) data provider; it's recommended to use the
    `util/continue` API data provider in the `qorus-api` factory instead
