    ## Summary


    Base class for using the data-provider request API to make requests; no
    configuration


    **NOTE**:  This building block's functionality has been superceded by an API
    (request - response) data provider; it's recommended to use the
    `data-provider/do-request` API data provider in the `qorus-api` factory
    instead

    class.
