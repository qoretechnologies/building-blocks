    ## Summary


    Base class for building block classes for creating records in record-based
    data providers.


    This base class has no configuration; see `BBM_DataProviderRecordCreate` for
    a usable building block with connectors and configuration.


    **NOTE**:  This building block's functionality has been superceded by an API
    (request - response) data provider; it's recommended to use the
    `data-provider/create` API data provider in the `qorus-api` factory instead
