    ## Summary


    Provides input data to a data pipeline; note that this class ignores input
    data passed to it but rather only provides data to the next element based on
    its configuration.


    This class is suitable for using as the first step in a pipeline to pass
    existing data into a pipeline for processing.


    ## Processor Description


    Uses input data only for resolving the output data from config item
    `get-pipeline-data`; the input data is not passed through to the next
    element in the pipeline unless it's referenced in the `get-pipeline-data`
    config item.


    Local data (in this case, the processor's input data) for the call to
    `UserApi::expandTemplatedValue()` is the input argument data for the
    connector available as `$local:input.
