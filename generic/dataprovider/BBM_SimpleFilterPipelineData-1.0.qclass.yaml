    ## Summary


    This building block provides a pipeline processor element that does simple
    record filtering.  It supports bulk processing.


    ## Pipeline Processor


    This building block's pipeline processor uses each data record as local
    context and then evaluates `simple-filter-criteria` on each record.  If the
    result of the evaluation is boolean `true`, then the record is accepted and
    passed on for further processing.  If not, the record is ignored.


    Ex: If the input record is `{key1: value, type: 2}`,
    `simple-filter-criteria` = `$qore-expr:{$local:type == 1}`, then the filter
    criteria config item will result in `False` which will result in the record
    being rejected.  The example filter criteria only accepts records where
    `type == 1` (if you want to also reject records without a type, then you
    could use `$qore-expr:{$local:type??{0} == 1}`).


    Bulk processing is supported in the same manner, and the "hash of lists" is
    rebuilt without references to the discarded records.


    **Boolean Evaluation Table**


    |**Data**|**Example Values**|**Description**|

    |:---|:---|:---

    |`True` or `False`|True|direct interpretation

    |empty string, hash, list, or binary value|`""`, `{}`, `[]`|`False`

    |int, float, number, or string 0|`0`, `0.0`, `"0"`|`False`

    |non-empty string and not `"0"`|`"string"`|`True`

    |non-empty hash, list, or binary value|`{key: value}`|`True`

        This should be a template with each current data used as the local context;
        if the current data is not a hash, then it will be placed in the `data` key
        of the local context hash.
    
        A return value of `true` means "process the data onwards", `false` means
        "ignore".
