    Example **Create Customer** Service


    This service uses a Swagger schema to provide a REST API to simulate
    creating a customer in a CRM system.


    In this case the storage for the customer data is made up of two DB tables.


    This service will listen on a random port when started; call the `getPort()`
    method to get the port the service is listening on.


    The OpenAPI / Swagger schema can be acquired with an authenticated call to
    the Qorus server:
    *...*`/api/latest/services/example-create-customer/resource_files/example-customer-schema-1.0.yaml/data`
    (note that this returns a YAML or JSON string according to the client's
    `Accept` header for the schema) - examples:

    - `qrest
    services/example-create-customer/resource_files/example-customer-schema-1.0.yaml/data`

    - `curl -k -u my-qorus-user:password
    https://localhost:8011/api/latest/services/example-create-customer/resource_files/example-customer-schema-1.0.yaml/download`


    Make sure to deploy the schema first: `oload CrmCustomerExampleSchema.qsm` -
    this will create the DB definitions (sequences, tables, triggers, etc)
    necessary to support the REST API.


    The schema will be written to the `omquser` datasource and will create the
    following two tables:

    - `crm_customer_example`

    - `crm_address_example`


    Additionally, two sequences will be created as well.


    The REST API endpoints can be seen below in the service configuration; each
    one has a hand-coded method.  


    This example service is written in Qore.
