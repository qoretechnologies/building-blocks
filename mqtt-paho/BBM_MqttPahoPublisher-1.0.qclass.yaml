    ## Summary


    [MQTT Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) client for publishing messages to
    an MQTT topic


    ## Connectors


    ### Input/Output Connector `publishFromConfig`


    Used to publish a message from config item `mqtt-paho-message-body`.


    The input data is available as `$local:input` for all config items resolved
    with this connector (in the call to `UserApi::expandTemplatedValue()`).


    Message data is converted to a binary for publishing, if necessary by first
    converting to a string.


    The output data is the `org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttMessage` object
    published.


    ### Input/Output Connector `publish`


    Used to publish a message from data passed as input; if no value is passed,
    then the message data is taken from config item `mqtt-paho-message-body`.


    The input data is converted to a binary if necessary, if necessary by first
    converting to a string.


    The output data is the `org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttMessage` object
    published.


    Is is recommended to use the `publishFromConfig` connector instead.

        Sets the quality of service for this message.
    
    
        - `0`: Quality of Service 0 - indicates that a message should be delivered
        at most once (zero or one times). The message will not be persisted to disk,
        and will not be acknowledged across the network. This QoS is the fastest,
        but should only be used for messages which are not valuable - note that if
        the server cannot process the message (for example, there is an
        authorization problem), then an
        `MqttCallback.deliveryComplete(IMqttDeliveryToken)`. Also known as *"fire
        and forget"*.
    
        - `1`: Quality of Service 1 - indicates that a message should be delivered
        at least once (one or more times). The message can only be delivered safely
        if it can be persisted, so the application must supply a means of
        persistence using `MqttConnectOptions`. If a persistence mechanism is not
        specified, the message will not be delivered in the event of a client
        failure. The message will be acknowledged across the network. This is the
        default QoS.
    
        - `2`: Quality of Service 2 - indicates that a message should be delivered
        once. The message will be persisted to disk, and will be subject to a
        two-phase acknowledgement across the network. The message can only be
        delivered safely if it can be persisted, so the application must supply a
        means of persistence using `MqttConnectOptions`. If a persistence mechanism
        is not specified, the message will not be delivered in the event of a client
        failure.
    
        If persistence is not configured, QoS 1 and 2 messages will still be
        delivered in the event of a network or server problem as the client will
        hold state in memory. If the MQTT client is shutdown or fails and
        persistence is not configured then delivery of QoS 1 and 2 messages can not
        be maintained as client-side state will be lost.
